<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thrombus Extraction Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Thrombus Aspiration Catheters</li><li>Mechanical Thrombus Aspiration Catheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thrombus extraction catheter market is divided into two primary types: manual and mechanical thrombus aspiration catheters. Manual thrombus aspiration catheters require physician-driven techniques to remove thrombus through suction, allowing for more control during the procedure. In contrast, mechanical thrombus aspiration catheters employ automated mechanisms to facilitate the removal of blood clots, offering a faster and potentially more efficient alternative. Both types are vital in interventional cardiology for treating conditions like acute coronary syndrome and ischemic strokes.</p></p>
